Module/MagicUse version 0.3
===========================

If you use a constructor this module will try to include the calling module.
For example

	my $q = CGI->new();

will include the CGI module. The pattern of a construtor is this

	new Module

or

	Module->constructor

So it will explicitly look for a new before what looks like a module name
if you're using indirect method syntax. However with direct method invocation
syntax you just need what looks like a module pointing to what looks like a
method name. This should be fairly reliable since modules and methods can be
mapped pretty simply to regexes.
